### First Insights

At this point in the investigation we know that a machine associated with Online Operations and Production Servicest (OOPS) company has communicated with the foreign Listening Post. From the previous task, we were able to identify the employee associated with the account on the machine. During an incident response interview, the user mentioned that they were checking email around the time that the communication occured. They stated that they did not remember anything weird that occured while checking email. The led OOPS to provide us with a subset of the user's inbox from the day of the incident.
