### What is the NSA codebreaker challenge

The NSA CodeBreaker challenge is a year competion between schools where "The NSA ... provides students with a hands-on opportunity to develop their reverse-engineering / low-level code analysis skills while working on a realistic problem set centered around the NSA's mission." The competion is divided into 2 parts, solo and team, each consiting of 6 and 4 challenges respectivly.

### Overview of each challenge

#### Task 1
The challenge discription is as follows:

> The NSA Cybersecurity Collaboration Center has a mission to prevent and eradicate threats to the US Defense Industrial Base (DIB). Based on information sharing agreements with several DIB companies, we need to determine if any of those companies are communicating with the actor's infrastructure.

> You have been provided a capture of data en route to the listening post as well as a list of DIB company IP ranges. Identify any IPs associated with the DIB that have communicated with the LP.

And you are given:
    Network traffic heading to the LP (capture.pcap)
    DIB IP address ranges (ip_ranges.txt)


#### Task 2

#### Task 3

#### Task 4

#### Task 5

#### Task 6

### Detection and defense of attacks
It is important to note that the senirio given assumes that the NSA had already compromised the malicus listening post and captured the packets to discover the comprimise. This is unrilistic for the average company as it is illigal to attack suspected mallisuous servers in the US.
