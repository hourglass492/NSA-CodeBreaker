### First Insights

At this point in the investigation we now know that we had a malicious script execute on an employee's machine. Now that we have discovered the script, we need to examine the code being executed to determine what data the malware stole from the machine and sent to the LP. This will require a full breakdown of the malware and examination of files that the script accessed. This task attached an artifacts.zip, which contained multiple PuTTY and WinSCP keys and the employee's NTUSER.dat file. With these given files, along with the malware script, we have a good route to determine the extent of the breach.
